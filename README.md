# 👋 Hi, I’m Antony Evans

Entrepreneurial COO & YC-backed founder, now building at the intersection of **AI, data, and operations**.  
I combine a background in mathematics (Cambridge) and startup leadership (INSEAD MBA, YC, Bain/Oliver Wyman) with **hands-on coding** in Python, SQL, and AI agent frameworks.  

I’m currently focused on **AI engineering** — building LLM-powered agents, automation tools, and data-driven systems.
